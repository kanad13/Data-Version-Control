# An Introduction to Data Version Control (DVC)

- This repository provides an introduction to the Data Version Control (DVC) tool.
- It covers various aspects of DVC, including initialization, adding data, setting up remotes, and pushing data to remote storage.
- The content is presented in a Jupyter notebook format with code examples and explanations.
- Mermaid diagrams are used to visualize concepts and workflows.
- If you are eager to read the content, you can view the notebook directly on GitHub by [clicking here](data_version_control.ipynb).

## How to use this repository

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Create a virtual environment and install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
- Open the `data_version_control.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to view the content.
- Run the code cells in the notebook to execute the DVC commands and see the results.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about DVC and its features.

## Topics covered in this repository

- **About Versioning**
  - This section introduces the concept of versioning and its importance in data science projects.
  - `Introduction to Versioning`
    - This section introduces the concept of versioning and its importance in data science projects.
  - `Evolution of Versioning`
    - This section discusses the evolution of versioning with file names and the benefits of using Git for code files.
  - `Git Benefits for Code Files`
    - Highlights the advantages of using Git for versioning code files, such as tracking exact changes, branching and merging, and maintaining commit history.
  - `Git Limitations for Big Data`
    - Outlines the limitations of Git when dealing with large datasets and non-text files.
  - `Data Version Control`
    - Introduces DVC and its features, including versioning large data files, working with Git and cloud storage, versioning models and pipelines, and tracking experiments.
  - `Git & DVC Together`
    - Explains how Git and DVC can be used together to manage projects that include code files, data files, and machine learning models.
- **DVC Basics**
  - Demonstrates the basic functionality of DVC, including initializing a DVC repository, adding data to DVC, and comparing DVC with Git.
  - `Initialize DVC Repository`
    - Shows how to initialize a DVC repository.
  - `Stage and Commit Changes`
    - Explains how to stage and commit changes using Git commands.
- **DVC commands**
  - This section covers various DVC commands for managing data files, remotes, and pipelines.
  - `DVC Get`
    - Demonstrates how to retrieve a file from a remote repository.
  - `DVC Add & Commit`
    - Explains how to add and commit data files to DVC.
  - `DVC Remotes`
